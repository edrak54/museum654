    <h2>Why We Fight: Prelude To War</h2>
    <h3>DIR. Frank Capra & Anatole Litvak<br>USA, 1942</h3>
    <p><i>Prelude To War</i> is the first of 7 propaganda films created by Frank Capra which were released throughout the years of the World War II. It is one of the most famous 
    propaganda films of this time period. Originally written for soldiers but eventually chosen for public distribution by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the film aims to express 
    to American viewers the importance of their participation in the war. This was a significant piece of media towards these war efforts, as the American opinion of the war had 
    been primarily one of disinterest and disapproval in getting involved. </p>

    <h2>This Is The Army</h2>
        <h3>DIR. Michael Curtiz<br>USA, 1943</h3>
        <p>Not all films of the 1940's were purely propaganda and serious news coverage. In fact, while the world was in the midst of the war, the highest grossing movie in America
        was actually a comedy musical! <i>This Is The Army</i> may still have involved wartime as a backdrop, but it brought much needed comedic relief to the American public. 
        Interestingly, the film is set in the time of the first World War, which for audiences of that time was only a few decades earlier. Look closely too, there's a future American
        president in the cast! Ronald Reagan appears in the film as the character Johnny Jones.

        <h2>There Was A Father</h2>
        <h3>DIR. Yasujiro Ozu<br>JAPAN, 1942</h3>
        <p>On the other side of the frontlines of World War II, cinema was similarly still being produced and put out into the world. <i>There Was A Father</i> is a Japanese film from 1942
        that depicts a widowed schoolteacher struggling to raise his 10 year old son. A far cry from war propaganda films that dominated the world at the time, this film reminds us 
        that on both sides of a war, humans exist who are facing hardships and striving to do their best for their families. Additional scenes that had been censored by Japan's regime
        at the time were restored for a 2023 screening at the Venice Film Festival.
