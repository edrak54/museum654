            <h3>Mission Statement:</h3>
            <p>We aim to create an online visual culture platform that brings iconic museum collections from major
                cities, like New York, into a digital “museum” experience. We aim to bridge the accessibility gap by
                providing curated digital exhibitions to individuals who cannot physically visit these collections or
                are unaware of how to access similar materials online. This website will target national and
                international audiences, particularly those in underserved or remote regions, offering them the
                opportunity to explore and learn from cities' rich cultural heritage. Each exhibit is framed with a
                curatorial perspective, providing educational context to enhance the audience's understanding of these
                works.</p>
