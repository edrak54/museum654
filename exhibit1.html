        <h1>Modern Art in Motion</h1>
        <h4>by Emily Drachman</h4>
        <p>Futurism and Dada are both movements that are part of early modernism, specifically around the years of World War One. 
            Futurism took place largely in Italy just before the start of the war while Dada began just after the war. 
            Both groups were reacting to their circumstances in very different cultures despite such close temporal proximity. 
            The Futurists, in an attempt to move past the classical history that was so revered in Italy, were all in on new 
            technology and industry. The Futurists sought to glorify war in contrast to the Dada artists, working after the onset 
            of WWI who were reacting to very real horrors that had previously been unimaginable. Dada is a reaction to a world 
            which did not make much sense and thus often includes nonsensical elements in their work. Both groups push against 
            norms and seek to disrupt accepted systems. Each brings a distinct and important perspective to understanding the 
            time period during which they were working.</p>

                <h2>Futurism</h2>
                <h3>The Futurist Manifesto</h3>
                <p>The Futurist manifesto was a founding document for Futurist art. It was published by the poet F. T. 
                    Marinetti in 1909. Futurism was focused on the future, new technology, and swift departure from all 
                    things past. Being an Italian movement, they felt that Italy was particularly focused on the 
                    classical past. The manifesto calls for a destruction of the past including museums, libraries, 
                    and academies. Writing just before World War One, they also call for the glorification of war and 
                    militarism. Their focus was on the future and technology and a destruction of all else.</p>

                <h2>Dada</h2>
                <p>During the First World War, Dada was an art movement reacting to the horrors of that time. 
                    Hugo Ball was a writer and the founder of Dada. The art of the movement is united by anti-war sentiments 
                    and often used satire or nonsensical elements as critique of the war and a society which caused it. </p>

                <h4>Umberto Boccioni, 1913, cast 1950</h4>
                <p id="boccioni">Umberto Boccioni’s sculpture, <i>Unique Forms of Continuity in Space</i> is one of the most emblematic pieces of 
                    Futurist sculpture. The sculpture depicts a man moving incredibly dynamically. The static sculpture has a 
                    forward moving energy to it. Not only is the man sculpted, but there is a suggestion of the environment around 
                    him in the air which he is displacing as he speeds along, particularly in the swirling shapes around his legs.</p>

                <h3>Cut with the Kitchen Knife Dada Through the Last Weimar Beer-Belly Cultural Epoch of Germany</h3>
                <h4>Hannah Höch, 1919</h4>
                <p id="hoch">Hannah Höch’s <i>Cut with the Kitchen Knife Dada Through the Last Weimar Beer-Belly Cultural Epoch in Germany</i> 
                    is a photomontage piece commenting on the Dada movement and the contemporary politics of Germany at the time. Photomontage 
                    and collage art was widely used amongst Dada artists. It allowed the appropriation of popular imagery and newspaper 
                    clippings and also suggested the fragmentary nature of culture as the Dada artists saw it. For this piece particularly, 
                    Höch uses the images of prominent figures, both fellow Dada artists as well as political figures. The composition is a bit 
                    chaotic and it can be difficult to parse through to recognize individual elements, but the piece can be read in quadrants. 
                    The top right shows the “anti-dada”, including various politicians at the time. The lower right is the Dada quadrant, 
                    including many prominent Dada Artists who Höch knew such as Raoul Hausmann, George Grosz, and Niddy Impekoven as well as 
                    various communist leaders. The left side shows a broader Dada movement. The top left includes Albert Einstein saying 
                    “Dada is not an art trend” implying the movement is larger than a passing trend in art and that it is political and is 
                    here to stay. The bottom left depicts crowds of people around the Communist Party leader Karl Lienbknecht, who is saying 
                    “join Dada!” Höch also includes herself in the composition, at the bottom right on the corner of a map which shows countries 
                    where women had the right to vote. Höch also points to the role of women in politics and art with her title, <i>Cut with the 
                    Kitchen Knife</i>, which implies an element of the domestic labor that falls on women.

                <h4>Giacomo Balla, 1912</h4>
                <p id="balla">Giacomo Balla, another notable Futurist painter focuses on a study of motion in his <i>Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash</i>. 
                    The repetition and blur of leash and legs suggest the speed at which these figures are moving. The painting has a 
                    frenetic energy which suggests the dynamism which the Futurists thought contemporary everyday life should have. The 
                    painting is certainly influenced by early motion capture attempts including that by <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/265094">
                        Etienne-Jules Marey</a>, who was able to capture motion in a similar style photographically by including multiple 
                        exposures on one photographic plate. The effect of the repetition shows the various moments of a motion happening 
                        synchronously which creates the sense of movement in a static image.</p>

                <h3>Fountain</h3>
                <h4>Marcel Duchamp, 1917 (photograph by Alfred Stieglitz)</h4>
                <p id="duchamp">Marcel Duchamp’s <i>Fountain</i> is often met with skepticism both today and when he first created the piece. 
                    This piece is one of his most notable “readymade” works, a kind of artwork where an artist selects a commercially 
                    available object and names it as art. Duchamp pioneered “readymades” and in doing so, posed questions about what art 
                    really is. The story of the fountain specifically is that Duchamp bought the porcelain urinal at a plumbing supply 
                    store and signed it “R. Mutt”. He submitted Fountain to an unjuried art exhibition which caused much debate among 
                    the Society of Independent Artists in New York. Ultimately the work was rejected from the show but was photographed 
                    and featured in <i>The Blind Man</i>, a magazine published by Duchamp and his friends. The article featured a defense of 
                    <i>Fountain</i>, stating that the selection and naming of the work placed it in a new context whether the artist 
                    physically made the object or not.</p>
